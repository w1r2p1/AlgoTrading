TYPES OF MARKET ORDERS :

Market :        Buy or sell at the best available price in the current market.
                Fastest and most reliable way to enter or exit a trade and provides the most likely method of getting in or out of a trade quickly.
                It's a good idea to look closely at the bid-ask spread before placing a market order.


Limit :         Buy/sell at a specified price or better (is not guaranteed to be filled).
                Buy  : executed only at the limit price (or lower)
                Sell : executed only at the limit price (or higher)


Stop-Loss :     Activate a market order once a stop price has been met.   Warning : != Stop-Limit !


Stop-Limit :    Buy/sell at given price when a stop price has been met.
                Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price or better.
                A stop-limit order requires the setting of two price points :
                    Stop  : The start of the specified target price for the trade.
                    Limit : The outside of the price target for the trade.
                A timeframe must also be set, during which the stop-limit order is considered executable.

                SELL : Limit Price > Market Price > Stop Price
                BUY  : Limit Price < Market Price < Stop Price

                Buy example :   The current price is at $170. We place a stop at $180, limit at $185.
                                If the price moves above $180, the buy order is activated as long as it can be filled under $185.


Take Profit :   Limit order that specifies the exact price at which to close out an open position for a profit.


Take Profit
Limit       :   ?


Limit Maker :   Limit orders that will be rejected if they would immediately match and trade as a taker.


OCO :           One-Cancels-the-Other.
                Pair of orders (Limit + Stop-Limit) on the same side stipulating that if one order executes, then the other order is automatically canceled.
                The Time In Force for OCO orders should be identical.

                SELL : Limit Price > Market Price > Stop price of stop-limit order
                BUY  : Limit Price < Market Price < Stop price of stop-limit order

Taker :         Order that trades immediately before going on the order book (partially or fully).
                Therefore : Market, Limit IOC & Limit FOK orders are always Takers as they can never go on the order book.
                These trades are "taking" volume off of the order book, and therefore called the "taker."

Maker :         Order that goes on the order book (partially or fully).
